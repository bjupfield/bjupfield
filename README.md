# Hey I'm Bennett
Hi Weirdo looking at this. If you want to keep up with me, or find out what I'm actually currently working on text me or dm on discord.
The latest project I'm working on is an user-implementation of ffmpeg audio-redirecting implementing OpenGL directly for the graphical Interface.
This Project is planned to mostly be used to target specific audio-streams on a desktop, to allow for the easy recording of Specific Desktop Applications,
with limited intrusion. There are future plans for the project, but for now I'm keeping it simple. Also, working on a DWm side-project, but thats
going very slowly.

### "Languages/FrameWorks"

#### React, JavaScript, SQL, Rails, Ruby, CSS, C#, HTML, Learning C++ and C currently, also learning dll's language CIL or IL, and now java apparently
