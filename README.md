### Hey I'm Bennett
My area of Expertise is Full-Stack Software Engineering, and I back that up with my recent graduation from Flatirons Software Engineering program. I have a passion for any sort of funky coding you can throw at me, but always love to see things that both push the boundaries and are useful in the day to day.

Excellent Problem solver. Creativity is what I like to see when I'm coding, and ridiculous for loops or while statements are the stuff of my nightmares and what makes me able to sleep at night.

##Favorite Projects
#SVG-Creator/Personal-Website | [Repo]https://github.com/bjupfield/my-website

This repo holds the code for a site that I am in process of developing which I hope to eventually host on a private domain and include all of my side projects on. Howeever right now this project is only an SVG-Editor with small blender/photoshop aspects that will output a downloadable CSS file for your SVG needs. The projects utilizes React, Javascript, CSS, SQL, and Rails.

#UnityVr | [Repo]https://github.com/bjupfield/UnityVrProject

On this project I display all the script files I am using in unison with Unity. What I am most proud of right now on this project is creating a capability with the help of the Triangulator program for the player to draw an object out of thin air. These scripts are a work in progress. It is coded in C#.
