## Favorite Projects
### SVG-Creator/Personal-Website | [Repo](https://github.com/bjupfield/my-website)

This repo holds the code for a site that I am in process of developing which I hope to eventually host on a private domain and include all of my side projects on. Howeever right now this project is only an SVG-Editor with small blender/photoshop aspects that will output a downloadable CSS file for your SVG needs. The projects utilizes React, Javascript, CSS, SQL, and Rails.

### #UnityVr | [Repo](https://github.com/bjupfield/UnityVrProject)

On this project I display all the script files I am using in unison with Unity. What I am most proud of right now on this project is creating a capability with the help of the Triangulator program for the player to draw an object out of thin air. These scripts are a work in progress. It is coded in C#.
